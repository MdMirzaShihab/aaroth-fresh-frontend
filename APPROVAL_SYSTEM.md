# Business Entity Verification System

## Overview

The verification system ensures that vendors and restaurant users cannot perform critical business operations until their **business entities** (vendor business or restaurant) are verified by administrators. This maintains marketplace quality and security by verifying businesses, not individual users.

**üîß SYSTEM UNIFIED**: The approval system has been consolidated to use business entity verification only. User-level approval fields have been removed and all verification logic now operates at the business level with atomic transactions.

## How It Works

### Business Entity States

1. **Unverified** (Default): Business registered but not yet verified
   - All users can browse the platform
   - Users can view their profiles
   - Vendors cannot create listings until business is verified
   - Restaurant users cannot place orders until restaurant is verified

2. **Verified**: Business can access all platform features
   - **Vendor Business Verified**: All vendor users can create, update, and delete listings
   - **Restaurant Verified**: All restaurant users (owner + managers) can place orders

3. **Inactive**: Business deactivated by admin
   - Users can view deactivation reason
   - Can contact admin for assistance

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Business Unverified | Business Verified | Business Inactive |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Vendor** | Browse only | Full listings management | View-only + contact admin |
| **Restaurant Owner** | Browse only | Full order placement | View-only + contact admin |
| **Restaurant Manager** | Browse only | Full order placement | View-only + contact admin |
| **Admin** | Full access | Full access | Full access |

### Key Benefits of Business-Entity Verification

1. **Team Access**: When a restaurant is verified, ALL its managers can immediately place orders
2. **Business Focus**: Verification applies to the business entity, not individual employees
3. **Scalability**: Adding new restaurant managers doesn't require separate approvals
4. **Logical Structure**: Aligns with real business operations where the business gets verified, not each employee

### New API Endpoints

#### Get User Status
```
GET /api/v1/auth/status
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "name": "User Name",
      "email": "user@example.com",

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Messages

When users from unverified businesses try to perform restricted actions, they receive clear error messages:

**Unverified Vendor (trying to create listing):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Your vendor business \"Fresh Produce Co\" is not verified. You cannot create listings until your business is verified by admin."
}
```

**Unverified Restaurant (trying to place order):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Your restaurant \"Green Kitchen\" is not verified. You cannot place orders until your restaurant is verified by admin."
}
```

**Restaurant Manager (trying to place order for unverified restaurant):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Your restaurant \"Green Kitchen\" is not verified. You cannot place orders until your restaurant is verified by admin."
}
```

## Admin Workflow

### Available Admin Endpoints

#### **Preferred Business Verification Endpoints** ‚≠ê

1. **Toggle Vendor Verification** (Atomic Transaction)
   ```
   PUT /api/v1/admin/vendors/:id/verification
   Body: { "isVerified": true/false, "reason": "optional" }
   ```

2. **Toggle Restaurant Verification** (Atomic Transaction)
   ```
   PUT /api/v1/admin/restaurants/:id/verification
   Body: { "isVerified": true/false, "reason": "optional" }
   ```

3. **Reset Vendor Status**
   ```
   PUT /api/v1/admin/approvals/vendor/:id/reset

## Frontend Integration

### Checking User Capabilities

```javascript
// Get user status
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/auth/status', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});

const { data } = await response.json();

// Check capabilities based on business verification
if (data.capabilities.canCreateListings) {
  // Show "Create Listing" button (vendor business is verified)
} else {
  // Show verification pending message
  console.log(data.restrictions.reason);
  console.log(data.nextSteps);
}

// For restaurant managers, they inherit restaurant verification status
if (data.capabilities.canPlaceOrders) {
  // Show "Place Order" button (restaurant is verified)
} else if (data.user.role === 'restaurantManager') {
  // Show message that restaurant needs verification
  console.log(`Restaurant "${data.businessVerification.businessName}" needs verification`);
}
```

### Handling Business Verification Status

```javascript
if (data.businessVerification.isVerified) {
  // Business is verified - enable all features
  enableAllFeatures();
  showVerifiedBadge(data.businessVerification.businessName);
} else {
  // Business not verified - show restrictions
  showVerificationPendingMessage({
    businessType: data.businessVerification.businessType,
    businessName: data.businessVerification.businessName,
    nextSteps: data.nextSteps,
    userRole: data.user.role
  });
}

// Special handling for restaurant managers
if (data.user.role === 'restaurantManager') {
  if (data.businessVerification.isVerified) {
    showMessage(`You can manage orders for verified restaurant "${data.businessVerification.businessName}"`);
  } else {
    showMessage(`Restaurant "${data.businessVerification.businessName}" needs admin verification before you can place orders`);
  }
}
```
