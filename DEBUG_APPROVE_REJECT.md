# 🔍 Debug Guide: Approve/Reject Functionality

I have added comprehensive debug logging to trace the approve/reject issue. Please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open Browser Developer Tools
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/admin-v2/vendors`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Clear any existing logs

## Step 2: Test Approve/Reject Flow
1. Click on any vendor card to open the details modal
2. **Make sure the vendor has `verificationStatus: 'pending'`** (check console logs)
3. Click the **Approve** or **Reject** button
4. If rejecting, enter a reason in the text area
5. Click the confirmation button in the dialog

## Step 3: Analyze Console Output
Look for these debug messages in order:

### Expected Flow:
```
🔍 VendorDetailsModal: vendor object structure: {...}
🔍 Vendor ID field: [some-id]
🔍 Vendor verification status: pending

🎯 Confirmation button clicked, showConfirmDialog: verify-approve
🎯 Triggering approve action

🔍 VendorDetailsModal: handleConfirmAction called with: verify-approve
🔍 Vendor ID: [vendor-id]
🔍 Confirm Reason: [reason-or-empty]
✅ Calling onVerify for APPROVE

🚀 VendorsManagementPage: handleVerificationAction called
📋 Parameters: {vendorId: "...", status: "approved", reason: ""}
🔧 updateVendorVerification function: [function object]

📡 Making API call with payload: {...}

🔧 RTK Query: updateVendorVerification called
📡 API URL: /admin/vendors/[vendor-id]/verification  
📋 Request Body: {status: "approved", reason: ""}
```

## Step 4: Check Network Tab
1. Go to the **Network** tab in Developer Tools
2. Look for HTTP requests to `/admin/vendors/*/verification`
3. Check if the request appears and what response it gets

## Step 5: Report Your Findings

Please share:

### A. Console Output
Copy and paste all the debug messages you see

### B. Network Activity  
- Are you seeing any HTTP requests to the verification endpoint?
- What is the response status code? (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- What is the response body?

### C. Vendor Data Structure
From the console logs, please share:
- The vendor object structure
- The vendor ID format (`_id` vs `id`)
- The verification status

### D. Any Error Messages
- JavaScript errors in console
- Network errors
- Toast error messages

## Common Issues to Check:

### Issue 1: Vendor Not Pending
- Only vendors with `verificationStatus: 'pending'` show approve/reject buttons
- Check if your test vendor has the correct status

### Issue 2: Authentication
- Make sure you're logged in as an admin user
- Check if the JWT token is being sent with requests

### Issue 3: Backend Endpoint
- Verify the backend server is running on port 5000
- Check if the endpoint `PUT /admin/vendors/:id/verification` exists

### Issue 4: ID Format Mismatch
- Frontend might be using `vendor._id` but backend expects different format
- Check the actual vendor ID in the console logs
