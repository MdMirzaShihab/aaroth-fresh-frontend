## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Protecting Features with Business Verification
```javascript
import CapabilityGate from '../components/verification/CapabilityGate';

// Only show listing creation for verified vendor businesses
<CapabilityGate capability="canCreateListings">
  <CreateListingForm />
</CapabilityGate>

// Only show order placement for verified restaurants
<CapabilityGate capability="canPlaceOrders">  
  <OrderPlacementForm />
</CapabilityGate>
```

### 2. Checking Business Verification Status
```javascript
import { useBusinessVerification } from '../hooks/useBusinessVerification';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    isVerified,
    businessName,
    canCreateListings,
    canPlaceOrders,
    showVerificationPending,
    getStatusDisplay
  } = useBusinessVerification();
  
  const status = getStatusDisplay();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {businessName}</h1>
      <VerificationStatusBadge 
        isVerified={isVerified}
        text={status.text}
        description={status.description}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 3. Admin Verification Management
```javascript
import EntityCard from '../components/admin/EntityCard';

// Display business entity with verification controls
<EntityCard
  entity={vendorBusiness}
  type="vendor"
  onToggleVerification={handleVerification}
  isVerificationLoading={isLoading}
/>
```

## 🎭 User Experience Flow

### For Unverified Business Users:
1. **Login** → User authenticates successfully
2. **Status Check** → System checks business verification status
3. **Capability Gate** → Features are conditionally rendered
4. **Pending Screen** → Clear guidance shown with next steps
5. **Profile Access** → Users can still update profile information

### For Verified Business Users:
1. **Login** → User authenticates successfully  
2. **Full Access** → All business features available
3. **Dashboard** → Complete analytics and management tools
4. **Operations** → Can create listings, place orders, etc.

### For Admins:
1. **Dashboard** → Overview of verification metrics
2. **Management** → Unified interface for all business approvals  
3. **Actions** → Quick verification toggle with reason tracking
4. **Analytics** → Business verification statistics and trends
